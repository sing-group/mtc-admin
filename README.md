# MultiTasking Cubes - Administrator

**MultiTasking Cubes (MTC)** is a project for developing a tool that may be used
for cognitive rehabilitation, based on the therapeutic game Memomdado,
developed by Adolfo Piñón Blanco [[1]](#ref1).

The **MTC Administrator** is the web administration interface of the system.
Three main user types can use this application:

* **Administrators**: they can manage institutions and the manager that manage
the institutions.
* **Managers**: they can manage the therapists that work on the institution
that they manage.
* **Therapist**: they can create new patients, games sessions and assign games
sessions to patients.

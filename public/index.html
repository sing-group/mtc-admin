      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the url of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public url.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public url by running `npm run build`.
